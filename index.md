Gender differences in social role, and gender inequality in terms of income, wealth, and work, have emerged as a core issue in the field of economics. Within the United States, questions of workplace equity and support for gendered labor remain hotly debated issues of economic policy. On a global scale, the World Bank has made gender empowerment a key plank for development policy, and gender equity remains one of the main areas of concern in the millennial development goals.
This course provides students with an introduction to the contemporary theories of gender from the lens of economics. Topics covered will include:
* Visibility and invisibility of gender in analysis of economic growth and development
* Gender divisions of labor in the home and beyond
* Gender at the workplace
* Gender in macroeconomic policy (e.g., government budgets)
